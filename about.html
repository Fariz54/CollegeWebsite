                <h2>COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">premier institution in Tamilnadu with International standards. It was established in 1984 at the outskirts of Dindigul township as a response to the clarion call made by the public for a quality engineering institution in
                    this part of South Tamilnadu.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">My college campus is a good place where I love to spend most of my day times. It is a huge area with more than 100 acres. There is a total of eight buildings for different departments. We keep a friendly and brotherhood environment on
                    the campus. There is a big playground in the middle of all campus areas. We play cricket there very often. As a good cricketer, I never miss any cricket tournament here. Sometimes we play football too. Our teachers and seniors are
                    really helpful and friendly on the campus. It is a peaceful environment to enjoy with your friends. There is a library building in the west zone. I spend most of my time there reading books. I love reading books. In the same building,
                    there is a science lab. I go there too for the chemistry classes. Overall my college campus is good and beautiful. Everyone loves to spend time here.
